# instructions-block
first custom block created using cursor

the original prompt was:
"make a plugin that has a custom block for entering and displaying instructions that shows in the wordpress admin but is hidden on the frontend"

my only followup tweaks were:
"the block should enable the user to enter custom instructions per page when using the block. currently it only has a standard message"
"the block needs to save the custom instructions when the page is saved"
"the saved instructions need to show any time the page is edited in the backend"
"the custom instructions are not saving and displaying in the admin upon page reload"
"this yields an error: Block contains unexpected or invalid content."
"add a header above the textarea called "Reminders from James""
"underneath the h3 please add paragraph text that says "this reminder will not show on the frontend""

this entire process took maybe 5 minutes.
